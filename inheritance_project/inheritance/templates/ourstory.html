    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
    <p>What would you leave behind to benefit the world?</p>  
<br/>
<br/>
    <h2>VISION</h2>
        <p>Humanity is the story of mankind. It includes every man, woman, and child born since the first human couple. It includes those not born yet, who no less will be valued to someone, somewhere.  It is a chain of random events. The contributions made by others.  Some are invisible to the naked eye. Some efforts have brought together people born miles apart, worlds apart, connecting them in blissful harmony.  Often, for a lifetime. The selfish actions of a few have sometimes altered our futures, forever. But everyone makes a contribution to the story of humanity, and consequently, our universe.  We have all been inspired by certain actions, or objects, for a moment, if not for our entire lives.  So... WHAT WILL YOU ADD TO THE STORY?</p>    
<br/>
